The first step in contributing to any project on GitHub is forking so that you can create [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). If you're not familiar with the idea of forking a repository, [GitHub has a super simple tutorial!](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)


### Cloning Backend

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ggpo-server
