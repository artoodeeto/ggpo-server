To configure environment variables first you have to create a `.env` file inside the root folder.

These are the list of keys and values that needs to run the application:

```
# APPLICATION
NODE_ENV=development
API_VERSION=v1
PREFIX=api
# 3hours in milisec. this should be the same with OVERNIGHT_JWT_EXP
# this will be use to set timeout on the frontend so user will be kicked out in the session
TOKEN_EXP=10800000 

# BCRYPT
SALT_ROUNDS=11

# MYSQL
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_DATABASE=development_db

# Overnightjs JWT package
OVERNIGHT_JWT_SECRET='your secret message here'
OVERNIGHT_JWT_EXP='3h'
```
