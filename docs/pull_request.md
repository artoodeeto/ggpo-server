- Try to keep the pull requests small. A pull request should try its very best to address only a single concern.
- Make sure all tests pass and add additional tests for the code you submit.
- Document your reasoning behind the changes. Explain why you wrote the code in the way you did. The code should be clear enough to explain what it does.
- If you are making changes to the API, make sure to update the version in the docs.
- If there's an existing issue related to the pull request, reference to it by adding something like References/Closes/Fixes/Resolves #305, where 305 is the issue number. [See GitHub's own guide on closing issues via PR](https://github.blog/2013-05-14-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/).
