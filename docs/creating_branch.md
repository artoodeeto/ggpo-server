## For creating a feature or a fix branch

When you are working on feature, or fixing a bug you will need to create a branch.

Our convention is we prefix our branch so that reviewer will have an idea on what the branch is about.

Feature branch:

`git checkout -b feat/the-new-feature`

Fix/Bug branch:

`git checkout -b fix/the-bug-fix`


For documentation:

`git checkout -b docs/the-documentation-branch`
